= How to display a form in posts or pages? =
Use the `[mc4wp_form]` shortcode.

= How to display a form in widget areas like a sidebar? =
Use the *MailChimp Sign-Up Form* Widget that comes with the plugin.

= How to display a form in my template files? =
Use the `mc4wp_form()` function.

= The form shows a success message but subscribers are not added to my list(s)? =
If the form shows a success message, it means MailChimp accepted the sign-up request and will take over from there. MailChimp could have a slight delay sending the confirmation email though, just be patient.

= How can I style the sign-up form? =
You can use CSS rules to style the sign-up form, use the following CSS selectors to target the various form elements.

`
.mc4wp-form { ... } /* the form element */
.mc4wp-form p { ... } /* form paragraphs */
.mc4wp-form label { ... } /* labels */
.mc4wp-form input { ... } /* input fields */
.mc4wp-form input[type="checkbox"] { ... } /* checkboxes */
.mc4wp-form input[type="submit"] { ... } /* submit button */
.mc4wp-alert { ... } /* success & error messages */
.mc4wp-success { ... } /* success message */
.mc4wp-error { ... } /* error messages */
` 

Add your custom CSS rules to the end of your theme stylesheet, **/wp-content/themes/your-theme-name/style.css**. Do not add them to the plugin stylesheet as they will be automatically overwritten on the next plugin update.

[PS: With the Pro version, you can design beautiful forms without touching any code >>](http://dannyvankooten.com/wordpress-plugins/mailchimp-for-wordpress/)

= Where can I find my MailChimp API key? =
[Here](http://kb.mailchimp.com/article/where-can-i-find-my-api-key)

= How to add a sign-up checkbox to my Contact Form 7 forms? =
Use the following shortcode in your CF7 form mark-up to display a sign-up checkbox. 

`[mc4wp_checkbox "My custom label text"]`

If you need more data for your merge fields, prefix the field name with `mc4wp-`.

*Example CF7 template for MailChimp WEBSITE field*
`
[text* mc4wp-WEBSITE]
`

= Can I add a checkbox to third-party forms? =
Yes. Go to *MailChimp for WP > Checkboxes* and tick the "show checkbox at other forms (manual)" checkbox. Then, include a checkbox with name attribute `mc4wp-try-subscribe` and value `1` in your form.

*Example HTML*
`
<label><input type="checkbox" name="mc4wp-try-subscribe" value="1" /> Subscribe to our newsletter?</label>
`

If you need to send more data to your MailChimp list, prefix the name attribute with `mc4wp-`.

*Example HTML code for MailChimp list field called WEBSITE*
`
<label>Your website:</label>
<input type="text" name="mc4wp-WEBSITE" />
`

= How do I add subscribers to certain interest groups? =
Use the field wizard. Or, if you know more about HTML, the following snippet should get you started. *Replace `###` with your grouping ID or grouping name.*

`
<label><input type="checkbox" name="GROUPINGS[###][]" value="Group 1" /> Group 1</label>
<label><input type="checkbox" name="GROUPINGS[###][]" value="Group 2" /> Group 2</label>
`
Or, if you want to use a hidden field...

`
<input type="hidden" name="GROUPINGS[###]" value="Groupname 1,Groupname 2,Groupname 3" />
`

= Why does the checkbox not show up at my comment form? =
Your theme probably does not support the necessary comment hook this plugin uses to add the checkbox to your comment form. You can manually place the checkbox by placing the following code snippet inside the form tags of your theme's comment form.

`<?php if(function_exists('mc4wp_checkbox')) { mc4wp_checkbox(); }?>`

Your theme folder can be found by browsing to `/wp-content/themes/your-theme-name/`.
