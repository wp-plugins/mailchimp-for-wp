= The form shows a success message but subscribers are not added to my list(s)? =
If the form shows a success message, it means the sign-up succeeded. 100%. MailChimp could have a slight delay sending the confirmation email though, just be patient.

= How can I style the sign-up form? =
You can use CSS to style the sign-up form. Use the following CSS selectors.

`
form.mc4wp-form{ ... } /* the form element */
form.mc4wp-form p { ... } /* form paragraphs */
form.mc4wp-form label { ... } /* labels */
form.mc4wp-form input { ... } /* input fields */
form.mc4wp-form input[type="checkbox"] { ... } /* checkboxes */
form.mc4wp-form input[type="submit"] { ... } /* submit button */
form.mc4wp-form .mc4wp-alert { ... } /* success & error messages */
form.mc4wp-form .mc4wp-success { ... } /* success message */
form.mc4wp-form .mc4wp-error { ... } /* error messages */
` 

Just add your CSS rules to the end of your theme stylesheet, **/wp-content/themes/your-theme-name/style.css**.

= Where can I find my MailChimp API key? =
[http://kb.mailchimp.com/article/where-can-i-find-my-api-key](http://kb.mailchimp.com/article/where-can-i-find-my-api-key)

= How to add a sign-up checkbox to my Contact Form 7 forms? =
Use the following shortcode to render a sign-up checkbox in your CF7 forms. 

`[mc4wp_checkbox "My custom label text"]`

If you need more data for your merge fields, prefix the field name with `mc4wp-`.

*Example CF7 template for MailChimp WEBSITE field*
`
[text* mc4wp-WEBSITE]
`

= Can I add a checkbox to a third-party form? =
Yes, you can. Go to MailChimp for WP > Checkbox Settings and tick the "show checkbox at other forms (manual)" checkbox. Then, include a checkbox with name attribute `mc4wp-try-subscribe` and value `1` in your form.

*Example HTML for checkbox in third-party form*
`
<input type="checkbox" name="mc4wp-try-subscribe" value="1" /><label>Subscribe to our newsletter?</label>
`

If you need to send more data for your list merge fields, prefix the name attribute with **mc4wp-**. The plugin will look for fields prefixed with `mc4wp-` and send the field values to MailChimp.

*Example HTML code for MailChimp WEBSITE merge tag*
`<input type="text" name="mc4wp-WEBSITE" /><label>Your website:</label>`

= How do I add subscribers to certain interest groups? =
Use the field wizard. Or, if you know more about HTML, the following snippet should get you started. *Replace `###` with your grouping ID or grouping name.*

`
<input type="hidden" name="GROUPINGS[###]" value="Groupname 1,Groupname 2,Groupname 3" />
`
Or, if you want to use checkboxes...

`
<input type="checkbox" name="GROUPINGS[###][]" value="Group 1" /><label>Group 1</label>
<input type="checkbox" name="GROUPINGS[###][]" value="Group 2" /><label>Group 2</label>
`

= Why does the checkbox not show up at my comment form? =
Your theme probably does not support the necessary comment hook this plugin uses to add the checkbox to your comment form. You can manually place the checkbox by placing the following code snippet inside the form tags of your theme's comment form.

`<?php if(function_exists('mc4wp_show_checkbox')) { mc4wp_show_checkbox(); }?>`

Your theme folder can be found by browsing to `/wp-content/themes/your-theme-name/`.
